# Discontinued
This repository is no longer being updated, but the code still works

# DiscordGo
This repository is a "fork" of github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo, but edited for user account

# Changes
Just created one function (UserProfile) and changed discordgo to discordgoself

# Discord Client
You can use this project to create a client entirely for users, but not for a full client
